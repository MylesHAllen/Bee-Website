            <h2>Clear Honey</h2>
            <img src="Images/clearHoney.jpg">
            <p>Clear honey is produced by passing honey through a fine filter cloth.
                The honey is usually warmed to about 35 degrees celsius and then passed
                through the cloth. The resulting liquid should be kept warm for about 
                24hrs and then bottled. The process wil remove most crystals of sugar and bubbles in the 
                honey and leave a bright clear liquid honey. If bees collect nectar fromn plants 
                that produce high glucose honey it is probably better not to try and produce 
                clear honey as it will rapidly revert to set honey.

        <div class="set">
            <h2>Set Honey</h2>
            <p>Set honey is honey that has been jarred as a liquid and then left to granulate
                naturally. The sugar crystals size and therefore the 'graininess' apparent when
                eating the honey depends on how fast the honey granulates. High glucose honeys
                will granulate and therefore appear 'smoother' to taste. If the temperature is 
                about 14 degrees celsius the maximum rate of setting is achieved; whereas below
                10 degrees celsius the honey becomes very stable and does not granulate.

        <div class="softSet">
            <h2>Soft Set Honey</h2>
            <img src="Images/sofSet.jpeg">
            <p>Soft set honey is at the consistency of butter so that it can be spread.
                Virtually any honey can be soft set honey. The honey is warmed until 
                liquid and allowed to cool to room temperature. About 10per cent of soft
                honey is then added to the liquid as a 'seed'. The sedding honey can 
                either be previously produced soft set honey or a warmed jar of oil
                seed rape honey (which always granulates quickly to produce fine crystals).
                The liquid honey and seed honey are mixed making sure not air bubbles
                are introduced. Once mixed the honey can be bottled and left at 
                14 degrees celsius until set. If the honey is kept in a cool place
                it will remain soft for a long time.
