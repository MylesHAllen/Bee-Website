        <div class="national">
            <h2>National</h2>
            <p>The national hive is probably the most common type of hive.
                It is a typical square shape with the outer dimensions being
                460mm and the brood (where the bees build up their colony) 
                being 225mm deep. The internal volume
                is around 35 litres. When the supers are added (the place
                where bees only store honey for our consumption) they add 
                around 22 litres. Supers and brood boxes can be added on 
                by simply stacking them where you want although weight
                consideration and maneuverability should be taken into account.

        <div class="WBC">
            <h2>WBC</h2>
            <img src="Images/WBCHive.jpeg">
            <p>The WBC is named after Reverend William Broughton Carr who designed the hive
                in the late 19th century. Its main feature is an internal construction of 
                boxes where the bees reside and an outer set of 'lifts' that provide weatherproofing
                and an attractive shape. The double-walled design creates insulation which allows
                the internal components to be made of a lighter material. This makes the hive more expensive
                and more complex to disassemble. The hive is more of a rectangle shape. The frame size
                is 355mm wide and 203mm deep. It has to use its own custom made supers. 
            </p>

        <div class="langstroth">
            <h2>Langstroth</h2>
            <p>The langstroth hive is probably the most popular design in the world. It is the standard hive in
                North and South America and Austrailia. It was made by Reverend Langstroth in 1851 and is reputed
                to have its dimensions based on a case of champaigne. It is of a rectangular shape. Due to its 
                large production size it tends to be a cheaper model than the WBC and National. It also has many 
                available modifications that are widely available. The frame size is around 457mm wide and 
                228mm deep. It has its own type of supers.
